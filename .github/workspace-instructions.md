# Workspace Instructions

This project is a collection of 'Hello World' GUI programs in various programming languages. Each example should animate the text 'Hello World' moving from left to right in a window. Contributors are encouraged to add new languages and improve existing examples.

Feel free to read this file for workspace-specific instructions and guidance for contributors.
