GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratuitously or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that everyone else also
receives or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Everyone deserves to be able to use software freely. By "software" we
mean program code, data, and any accompanying materials, regardless of
the medium of expression. This license applies to all of these, and
guarantees that everyone else can also use them freely.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensor" refers to the
individual, individuals, or organization that offers you the Program
under these terms.

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" is any non-source form of a
work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that is standard in at least
one widely used sense of the term, and that permits the exchange of
information among programs that conform to the interface, regardless of
the particular licenses under which they operate.

"Modification" means any addition to or change in a file or directory
containing the Program or in files or directories associated with it.
The result of running a modification may be a "modified version" of the
Program, but the term "modification" does not include the act of
running the unmodified Program.

"Combined work" is one that results from combining or linking an
executable version of the Program with other separate works, in such a
way that the executable version contains code from the Program, or is
derived from it.

1. Source Code.

The Licensor must make the source code available under the terms of
this License. The source code must be the preferred form in which a
developer would normally make changes to the Program. The Licensor may
distribute the source code in a compressed or archived form, provided
that the licensee is provided with the means to decompress or extract
it. If the Licensor distributes the Program in object code or
executable form, the Licensor must also make the source code available
in the manner specified herein.

2. Basic Permissions.

You are permitted to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Program,
subject to the limitations and conditions of this License. You may
distribute modified versions of the Program under the terms of section
3, and you may distribute copies of the Program or its modified
versions under the terms of this section 2, provided that you meet all
of these conditions:

a) You must keep intact the copyright notice and this license notice
in all copies or substantial portions of the Program.

b) You must provide a copy of this license along with the Program.

c) If you distribute modified versions of the Program, you must
clearly mark them as such, and you must include a description of the
changes made to create the modified version.

d) You must not misrepresent the origin of the Program, and you must
not imply that you or your use of the Program have been endorsed or
approved by the Licensor.

e) You must not use the name, logo, or other trademarks of the
Licensor or any contributor to the Program without their prior written
permission.

3. Copyleft.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by
this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,
or other charge for exercise of the rights granted under this License,
and you may not require acceptance of additional license terms or
conditions.

4. Distribution of Modified Versions.

You may distribute a modified version of the Program under the terms of
this section, provided that you meet all of these conditions:

a) You must clearly mark the modified files as changed.

b) You must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed
the files and the date of the change.

c) You must include a copy of this license with the modified Program.

d) You must not misrepresent the origin of the modified Program, and
you must not imply that you or your modifications have been endorsed or
approved by the Licensor.

e) If the modified Program is distributed in object code or
executable form, the source code for the modified Program must be made
available under the terms of this License.

5. Combination with Non-Free Programs.

If you combine the Program with other programs, the Licensor does not
require you to license the other programs under this License. However,
the Licensor does require that you keep this License intact so that
everyone else also has the freedom to share and change the Program.

6. Aggregation with Independent Works.

You may combine or aggregate the Program with independent works, or
distribute the Program as part of a larger work, such as a compilation
or anthology, provided that you do not impose any additional
restrictions on the Program. This License does not apply to the other
parts of the larger work, except as specifically stated herein.

7. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a modified version of the Program, either as
distributed or as part of a larger work, under the terms of this
License, provided that you meet all of these conditions:

a) You must include a copy of this license with the modified source
version.

b) You must keep intact the copyright notice and this license notice
in all copies or substantial portions of the Program.

c) You must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed
the files and the date of the change.

d) You must not misrepresent the origin of the modified Program, and
you must not imply that you or your modifications have been endorsed or
approved by the Licensor.

8. License Compatibility.

The Licensor encourages you to consider whether your modifications or
combination of the Program with other software might be covered by
other licenses. The Licensor does not impose a particular license on
you, but if you choose to distribute your modifications or the
combined work under a different license, you must comply with the terms
of that license as well as this License.

9. Warranty Disclaimer.

The Program is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.
In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any claim, damages, or
other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise,
arising from, out of, or in connection with the Program or the use or
other dealings in the Program.

10. Limitation of Liability.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
any contributor or Licensor be liable to you for any indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use
or inability to use the Program, even if such contributor or Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

11. Termination.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by you of the terms of this License.  You
may also terminate this License at any time by destroying all copies of
the Program in your possession or control.  All provisions of this
License that impose obligations on you shall survive termination.

12. Miscellaneous.

a) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding such
subject matter.

b) If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining
provisions shall be enforced.

c) This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides, without
regard to its conflict of law principles.

d) The GNU General Public License is intended to be a worldwide
license, and is not subject to any particular jurisdiction or
governing law.

e) Any action or proceeding arising under this License shall be brought
in the courts located in the jurisdiction in which the Licensor
resides, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of such
courts.

f) The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating the
Program into proprietary programs. If your distribution includes
proprietary components, you must provide complete and clear
documentation of your license terms for those components, and you must
make it clear that the GNU General Public License does not apply to
those components.

g) If you have not received a copy of this license along with the
Program, you may obtain a copy of the GNU General Public License from
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>.
